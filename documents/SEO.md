 SEO & Analytics Takeaways

 The key takeaways from introduction to SEO include the importance of ethical, or "white hat" SEO, educating oneself on best practices, or deciding to properly hire an SEO expert, and the technical fundamentals of SEO.

 Ethical SEO practices are crucial for establishing and sustaining integrity.  Unethical, or "black hat" SEO practices, such as attempting to spam and fool search engines have resulted in bankrupting businesses.  When building a business, it is necessary to decide early on how to allocate time and energy i.e. DIY SEO, or hiring an expert.  Since I am new to SEO, my focus will be on building a solid foundation according to Mozlow's Hierarchy of SEO Needs, which begins with crawl accessibility.  Creating compelling content is next, followed by keyword optimization.  

 Ideal introductory SEO plan for Vitals Studio

 Since Vitals Studio is a place to view and buy art online, I definitely want to be able to connect with a specific audience.  My first step on the pathway to connecting to my audience is ensuring I have clear sitemaps to submit for indexing.  Next, I want to focus on my crawl accessibility so that search engines may index my content.  To do this, I will use the Index Coverage report in Google's Search Console tool.  This will allow me to submit my sitemaps and check to see if they have been added to Google's index.  After being approved for indexing, using keyword research via Google's Keyword Planner tool will help connect me with my target audience.  These are the methods I would like to use to begin building an audience while I continue to build my website.
